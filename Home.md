## Cogent-House Wiki ##

This wiki provides some install information to help you get cogent-house up and running.

As developers, we've used this wiki to keep information that we needed to get stuff to work.

If you use the sidebar on the left and go through each of the items in order, you should end up with a working wireless sensing system. Note that some steps are optional. For example, you might not want to bother getting e-mails being sent out.

If any of the information is unclear, please let us know.
